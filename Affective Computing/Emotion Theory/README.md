### Emotions are STATES of emotional feeling.

> Emotions’ primary function is to mobilise an organism to respond quickly to prototypical events similar to those that were encountered in the past

There is a lack of uniformity within the scientific community on what emotion are and how we can represent them!

#### Theories of Emotions have Two main Categories:
- Cognition: stresses the importance of cognitive evaluation in establishing the meaning of stimuli.
- Somatic: emphasises somatic factors and describe expressions of emotional experiences in terms of bodily responses.


#### There are two approaches on emotions' structure:
- Discrete emotion approach: suggest the existence of six or more basic emotions (happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise)
- continuous emotion approach:  assumes the existence of two or more dimensions that describe and distinguish between different emotions


#### ER Methods:
- Neuro-Physiological Signal Processing: involve monitoring body responses to emotional stimuli.
- Observer Methods: a way to study emotions through the obser- vation of facial, vocal and gesture cues to emotional stimuli.
- Self-Report Methods: rely on simply asking participants to describe the nature of their experience.
