There is a lack of uniformity within the scientific community on what emotion are and how we can represent them!

Emotions are STATES of emotional feeling.

Theories of Emotions have Two main Categories:
    * Cognition
    * Somatic factorisable


> Emotionsâ€™ primary function is to mobilise an organism to respond quickly to prototypical events similar to those that were encountered in the past


There are two approaches on emotions' structure:
    * Discrete emotion approach: suggest the existence of six or more basic emotions (happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise)
    * continuous emotion approach:  assumes the existence of two or more dimensions that describe and distinguish between different emotions


### ER Methods:
    * Neuro-Physiological Signal Processing: involve monitoring body responses to emotional stimuli.
    * Observer Methods: a way to study emotions through the obser- vation of facial, vocal and gesture cues to emotional stimuli.
    * Self-Report Methods: rely on simply asking participants to describe the nature of their experience.
