The study propose a concept which uses brain signals from commercial grade Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) devices to detect museum visitors’ engagement in the exhibited objects.

> The aim is to personalize and enrich the museum experience according to the visitor’s state by detecting visual engagement of museum visitors using commercial BCI.

**EEG devices** measure brain signals by placing electrodes on certain locations on the scalp which measure changes in electrical potential as neurons in the brain’s cerebral cortex are fired.

_Alpha (α) => relaxation, Beta (β) => attentiveness and focus, and Theta (θ) => dreaminess and creativity._
